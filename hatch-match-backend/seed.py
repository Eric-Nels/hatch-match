Prepare the hook: Fix it securely in your vise and start your thread behind the eye of the hook.\n\n2. Create the body: Dub the thread with your chosen material and wrap it along the hook shank to form a tapered body. Stop just before you reach the eye of the hook, leaving some space for the hackle and wing.\n\n3. Tie in the hackle: Select a soft hackle feather with fibers about 1.5 times the hook gap. Tie it in by the tip at the front of the dubbed body. Make sure the shiny side of the feather faces toward the hook bend.\n\n4. Prepare the wing: Prepare your winging material, such as CDC feathers. Tie them in on top of the hook shank, just behind the eye, leaving the tips extending over the eye slightly.\n\n5. Ribbing (optional): If you choose to use ribbing, tie it in now. This step helps reinforce the fly and can add some attractive segmentation to the body.\n\n6. Wrap the hackle: With your hackle pliers, gently wrap the hackle feather around the hook shank, forming a soft, open collar. Make 2-3 wraps, securing it with thread, and trim off the excess hackle.\n\n7. Secure the wing: Fold the winging material back over the top of the fly and secure it with a few tight wraps of thread, trimming off any excess.\n\n8. Whip finish: Finally, whip finish your fly behind the eye of the hook, ensuring everything is securely tied down.\n\n9. Trim and tidy: Trim any stray fibers, and apply a small amount of head cement or UV resin to the thread wraps for added durability.")
